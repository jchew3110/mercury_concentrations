The benefits of using Github are many. The major benefit of adding to our spreadsheet through 'commits' is that we can track the history of changes to who and where if we make a mistake. It essentially works through updating the spreadsheet document on local machines which then commit to the online repository. Github then keeps track of the changes you have made to the most current version.
